Doubly Linked List
Overview
A Doubly Linked List is a type of data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element (known as a node) points to both its predecessor and its successor. This bidirectional linking allows for more flexible navigation compared to a singly linked list.

Structure
Each node in a Doubly Linked List contains three fields:

Data: Stores the value or information of the node.

Next: A reference to the next node in the sequence.

Previous: A reference to the previous node in the sequence.

plaintext
NULL <- [Prev | Data | Next] <-> [Prev | Data | Next] <-> [Prev | Data | Next] -> NULL
Advantages
Bidirectional Traversal: Allows traversal in both forward and backward directions.

Easier Deletion: Deleting a node can be easier since there's direct access to both the next and previous nodes.

Flexibility: Can be more flexible for certain operations like splitting the list, inserting at the end, etc.

Disadvantages
Extra Memory Usage: Requires more memory to store the Previous and Next pointers.

Complexity: The implementation is more complex due to the additional pointer management.

Operations
Insertion
Inserting a new node in a Doubly Linked List involves adjusting the Next and Previous pointers of the neighboring nodes and the new node.

Deletion
Deleting a node requires re-linking the Previous pointer of the next node and the Next pointer of the previous node to each other, effectively removing the node from the chain.

Traversal
Traversing can be done in both forward and backward directions. Starting from the head (or tail), you can follow the Next (or Previous) pointers until you reach the end of the list.

Conclusion

Doubly Linked Lists offer a flexible and efficient way to manage collections of data that require frequent insertions and deletions. While they use more memory and have a more complex implementation, their advantages in certain scenarios make them a valuable tool in a programmer's toolkit.
